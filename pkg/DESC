Breezy (brz) is a decentralized revision control system, designed
to be easy for developers and end users alike. By default, Breezy
provides support for both the Bazaar and Git file formats. Breezy
is a friendly fork of the Bazaar (bzr) project. It is backwards
compatibility with Bazaar's disk format and protocols. Breezy directly
supports both central version control (like cvs/svn) and distributed
version control (like git/hg).
